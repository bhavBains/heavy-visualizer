Thanks for joining the team!

The app is currently a SPA from an html file. To run our code locally:

Open the `index.html` file directly.

The background images won't work locally.

###Stretch goals:

As a user:
  I want to share my visualizers - so my friends can see them.
  I want to be able to browse the list of visualizers.
  I want to be able to log in and view my favourited and created visualizers.
  I want to use different themes to have more customization for visualizers.
